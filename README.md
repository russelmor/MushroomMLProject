# MushroomMLProject
This is a machine learning project I did for Machine Learning for Data Science course (DAT402) using the mushroom dataset (Naive Bayes + KNN).

In this project, I explored two ML models: Naive Bayes and KNN. The dataset is from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. I first began with data exploration, which was followed by imputing missing data and encoding. After fitting the training data and doing predictions on the test data, I evaluate the models using their accuracy rate, specificity rate, sensitivity rate and ROC curve as the performance measures. Additionally, I also measured their accuracy under cross-validation. The results look suspiciously good, but they seem to be in line with what others are getting based on discussions on Kaggle and Stack Overflow.
